# egg-mode-text

like twitter-text, but in rust

This library is an attempt to port [twitter-text] to Rust. It was originally part of [egg-mode], but
it's totally distinct from egg-mode type-wise, so i pulled it out into its own library. (Also it's
chock full of macros so it was also a bid to bring egg-mode's compile times down. `>_>`)

More details to come as i prepare to fully release this.
